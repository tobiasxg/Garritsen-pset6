The I am bored app.

This app is created as an easy way to tell people you are bored and you want to do something. The first two screens are the login screen
and the sign up screen are self explaining. They are used to create an account and save your data.  
The most important activities are the profile and social activity. On the social activity you can let everybody know that you are bored
by pressing a button. All people who are "bored" are placed on the bored list. You can also remove yourself from the bored list, by pressing
a button. If you click on someone on the bored list, you can start a conversation. It is however needed to load the data from Firebase,
by pressing the load button in both the profile and the social activity.
